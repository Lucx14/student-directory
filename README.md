# student-directory #

This is the first project at Makers Academy that we were set on the pre-course, which familiarised us with the the command line, working with a text editor, version control with Git, and basic Ruby

The script allows you to manage students enrolled at Makers Academy. It stores each student's name, cohort, age, hobby, and country. Through an interactive menu, you can show the list of students, input new students, save the list to a CSV file, or load an existing CSV file.

## How to use ##


```shell
git clone https://github.com/Lucx14/student-directory.git
```
Run the script:
```shell
$ cd student-directory
$ ruby directory.rb
```
